# Timeline for GraphAPI - C++ version

This is my timeline for this project:

* July  17th: 
    - Implement all functions in common.py and StandardGraph.py
    - This only includes the functions absolutely necessary for this to get running. 
    - Leave unused functions with TODOS

* July 20th: 
    - Write the driver functions.
    - Test this thoroughly

* July 23rd:
    - PageRank Implementation -- This will be fun
